Methodic
========

Test and interact with functions through a GUI. An editor window provides a
simple interface to select your script's functions and run them with parameters
of your choice. Ideal for manually triggering events during gameplay and for
modifying game objects in the editor.


Getting Started
---------------

Open the Methodic window by selecting the Window > Methodic menu item. If you
dig hotkeys, use shift-command-m (Mac) or shift-control-m (Windows) instead. I
like to keep this window docked below or beside the Inspector panel.

Click on a game object with your custom scripts attached. Methodic displays
the script's functions in a snazzy dropdown. If the selected function accepts
parameters, they are displayed in editable form below the dropdown.

Once satisfied with the parameter values to send, click the Invoke button to
run the function. If function returns a value, it is displayed in the Console.

Display options are available in Unity's preferences pane for the adventurous.


Limitations
-----------

Methodic currently lacks support for array parameters. In such cases, a null
value is sent when the function in invoked. This also happens when the
parameter type is unrecognized; say, if it's a class of your own creation.
